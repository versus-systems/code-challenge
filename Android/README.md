# Versus Systems Android Coding Challenge

Hello - and thanks for being interested in joining our team here at Versus Systems.

Youâ€™ll find an Android project attached.

## The Ask

* Group each character on their name
  * 'Mario' will have multiple entries - I only want to see him show up once on the dashboard.
  * The detail page - if you tap it - will show all of the grouped figures.


[ Format of the images / sprites for each pokemon ]

## Considerations

* There are both Card and Figure image assets - they're slightly different.
* The UI is hooked up but mostly unstyled.
* Change WHATEVER you want.  It's your world and I want to see how you do things.

## Delivery

When you finish, please send us a zip file or link to a Github repository for us to run and test. We expect this should take roughly 4-6 hours, but feel free to spend as little or as much time as you feel is right to produce something you feel good about sharing.

## Your thoughts

* If given a month how would you improve your contribution to this project to make it a viable solution?
  * If given 3 months?



## Stretch Goals

* Show off some CoRoutines in your implementation
  * Create a CoRoutine wrapper around the API you're using.

* Show off some Jetpack Compose in your implementation
* Dashboard Items should be sorted by name
