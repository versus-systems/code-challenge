# Versus Systems Android Coding Challenge

Hello - and thanks for being interested in joining our team here at Versus Systems.

Youâ€™ll find an Android project attached.

## The Ask

This code test makes use of the open [AmiiboAPI](https://www.amiiboapi.com)

* Group each character on their name
  * 'Mario' will have multiple entries - I only want to see him show up once on the dashboard.
  * The detail page - if you tap it - will show all of the grouped figures.

Note: Please don't include Unit Tests - a quick summary of what you'd test will suffice.

## Considerations

* The UI is hooked up but unstyled.
* Change WHATEVER you want.  It's your world and we want to see how you do things.

## Delivery

When you finish, please send us a zip file or link to a Github repository for us to run and test. We expect this should take roughly 4-6 hours, but feel free to spend as little or as much time as you feel is right to produce something you feel good about sharing.

## Your thoughts

* If given a month how would you improve your contribution to this project?
  * 2 months?
  * What would you focus on first and why?




## Stretch Goals

* Show off some CoRoutines in your implementation
* Show off some Jetpack Compose in your implementation
* Dashboard items sorted by name
* Better dashboard images
